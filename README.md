It basically just looping through every files in the specifed Minecraft datapack folder and then modify the content of its file by removing space and comments!

# How To Use It

2. Download this repository (or just the `index.js` file if you want)
4. Make a backup of your datapack folder, just incase the code messed up your datapack
5. Move `index.js` inside your datapack folder (alongside `pack.mcmeta`)
6. Run `node .` in terminal inside your datapack folder
7. Every comments and spaces are now gone from your mcfunctions :)
